I created this template to show as I started my .net core application.

  - This project will be a scaffolding to start a application
  - It will have tests
  - It will have swagger

# How to use!

  - The first step, you will need to do the clone of this repository.
  - After you'll need run these commands.
  
```sh
$ dotnet restore
$ cd Api
$ dotnet run
```

Look that:
  - The localhost will be ``` http://localhost:5000 ```
